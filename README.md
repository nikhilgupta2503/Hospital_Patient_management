This document outlines the design and implementation of a relational database system to manage patient and doctor information, medical records, and treatment details.

‚ùì Problem Statement
A hospital needs an efficient Patient Management System to handle patient records, doctor appointments, treatment histories, and performance metrics. The system should support electronic health records (EHR), patient demographics, medical diagnoses, treatments, and doctor information. Additionally, it should facilitate the analysis of patient demographics, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and overall hospital performance.

‚úîÔ∏è Solution Overview
We will design and implement a relational database system to store comprehensive data on patients, doctors, medical records, and treatments. SQL queries will be utilized to analyze various aspects, including patient demographics, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance metrics.

üéØ Tasks
Database Schema:
Patients: Contains patient demographic information.
Doctors: Stores information about doctors and their specializations.
MedicalRecords: Includes details about medical records, such as admission and discharge dates, diagnoses, treatments, and associated doctor IDs.# Hospital_Patient_management

‚≠ê Final Analysis:

Retrieve Names of Patients Along with Admission and Discharge Dates.
List Patients Diagnosed with Hypertension or Diabetes.
List Patients Treated by Doctors Specializing in Cardiology.
List Top 3 Doctors Who Treated the Most Patients.
